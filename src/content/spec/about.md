A little more about me than my resume! 

I'm a 3D printing enthusiast since roughly 2017 when I bought my Creality Ender 3 and I tinker with it ever since. I'm learning 3D modeling in Onshape as I want to create my own products and share them with you.

My passion for IoT and electronics go besides work as I love to play with my Arduinos ESPs and Raspberry Pi's for fun projects.

In my free time I also love to watch series and read amazing storys (the last one was The Witcher series, I loved it!)

I learned a little about graphic design and Adobe Illustrator during my college years to create content for the student group I was involved.

Besides my technical projects the endeavour I enjoyed the most being part of was the foundation of a junior company which helps students to learn how the job market works and provide them soft and hard skills to better prepared for it.

Fun fact: I'm also a personal finance enthusiast!
